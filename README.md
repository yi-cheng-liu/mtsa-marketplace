This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) website aimed at enhancing the user experience for MTSA's second-hand marketplace on Facebook. Since every seller have to post a PowerPoint for selling the items. Here are some of the issues I focused on improving:

1. The need to open a PowerPoint presentation to view items.
2. Lack of categorization for items.
3. Items that have been sold but are still listed due to outdated information.
